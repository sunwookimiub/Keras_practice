# Named_Entity_Recognition_Keras

This small project focuses on named entity recognition in the natural language processing domain. The dataset is comprised of three features (word token, part of speech tag (POS), entity POS) with corresponding named entity targets. Using more than one feature is quickly explored by prototyping a Bidirectional LSTM in Keras, and it does show that using more does improve performance on just the training set alone. Other models with validation and testing datasets on Tensorflow should be explored. The results are visualized using a confusion matrix.
